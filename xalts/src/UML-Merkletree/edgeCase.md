// Merkle Tree


1. Adding a new address to whitelisted and blacklisted list.
2. Need to update the smartcontract and merkle root each time. Therefore gas will be spent.
3. Removing address from the whitelist and blacklist is little expensive
4. Handling a merkle tree with deep deapth is expensive and impact on efficiency.
5. When you have an extremely large number of addresses to whitelist or blacklist, constructing and updating the Merkle Tree can become computationally expensive and gas-intensive. It's essential to optimize the tree-building process and consider gas costs.
